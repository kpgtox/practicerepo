      Lorem Ipsum is simply <span class="class1">dummy</span> text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make
      a type specimen book. It has survived not only five <span class="class2">centuries</span>, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.
